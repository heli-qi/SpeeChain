46ec0216 overall consumer spending has slowed since last year's stock market crash but it's still at a level that worries some economists

47ac0210 the cuomo plan doesn't stop at gouging new york taxpayers and long island ratepayers
47ac0211 federal taxpayers also will contribute
47ac0212 the key to the deal is that lilco also would get a two point five billion dollar tax write off for shoreham

47dc030h justice lewis powell acknowledged that the nineteen eighty two case of edgar versus
47dc030i m. i. t. e. suggested that any state law that favored targets more than did the williams act would be invalid because congress had preempted local regulations

47nc0316 it does not however seem reasonable to the germans who are instead mulling a tax increase to shore up a leaky government budget
47nc0318 what's wrong with that
47nc0319 generally there's no limit on how much of their funds employees can borrow if their accounts total ten thousand dollars or less

499c041b full deductibility would promote mobility of capital and efficient pricing of assets
499c041c it would obviously promote more venture capital with high gains and high risks
499c041d mere indexing by contrast would help the big and dull investments with low risks and humdrum rewards
499c041e but if full deductibility of losses would be good for economic growth it would be bad in two other ways
49ac0201 the operating rate is still kind of low but it's coming back said priscilla luce senior economist at wharton econometric forecasting associates in philadelphia
49ac0202 there is some cause for optimism

49ac020m so far no judge has attempted to fix an absolute cap on a group of claims as huge and uncertain as those facing robins
49ac020n another reason mr. soifer is avoiding morgan and citicorp is that their stock prices at times have tended to gyrate more violently than other bank issues
49ac020o citicorp and morgan tend to have more volatility on days when program trading is known to occur mr. soifer says
49ac020p they're more of a bet on which way the market is headed

49ac021a the computer giant is mainly trying to buy technology or expertise in certain areas such as software for insurance companies in the case of its policy management stake
49ac021b i. b. m. also seems to be trying to buy software developers' loyalty in the increasingly competitive industry

49ac030h also biotechnology companies are cash guzzlers constantly needing money for clinical trials and manufacturing facilities
49ac030i the critical factor for most companies isn't how much cash they have but how it's being spent mr. maccallum says

49ac0408 when hu yaobang was dumped in january as the communist party's secretary general mr. zhao was elevated to that post on an acting basis
49ac0409 that made mr. zhao a protege of deng xiaoping the de facto head of the party as well as the government
49ac040a it is a delicate position requiring him to maneuver among various interest groups and personal cliques that make up china's top leadership
49ac040b some have characterized our countermeasures as protectionist brought about because of congressional pressures
49ac040c that is dead wrong

49fc040y certain elements of a national system were obvious and quickly made their way into use
49fc040z the first was a composite tape that brought information from various market centers onto one ticker tape
49fc0410 a composite quotation display system soon followed allowing customers and brokers to see quotes from all markets on a single screen

49gc0214 back in nineteen seventy six he was giving president ford the incumbent's four point advantage
49gc0215 after the election he took it away
49gc0216 unlike lyndon johnson mr. ford wasn't ever elected vice president mr. fair explains feebly

49gc0218 such plans make educators cringe
49gc0219 they worry that a college degree could be reduced to a few trips to the notes department

49gc0307 the nineteen seventy two a. b. m. treaty requires a review every five years
49gc0308 communiques announcing completion of the first and second reviews were issued on november four nineteen seventy seven and november nine nineteen eighty two
49gc0309 the third review was due by october three nineteen eighty seven
49gc030a the most optimistic estimates are now that it will start sometime after the first of the year
49gc030b the reagan administration in short is conspiring with the soviets to violate the review provisions of the treaty
49gc030c no one seems quite sure how the publisher juggles his assets among his various companies which include the publicly owned maxwell communication corp. and various private ones
49gc030d control of the public company and of private interests like mirror group newspapers limited rests with a foundation in liechtenstein pergamon holding foundation about which little is disclosed
49gc030e he says its beneficiaries are charities which he promises to identify someday soon

49gc030j i'm waiting to see what the conditions are he said
49gc030k a senior administration official however called the gorbachev statement a watershed event because it will increase expectations among soviet people for withdrawal
49gc030l regardless of how the foreign purchases begin they often involve the very parts that make weapons perform

49gc030o mr. iacocca said that while the pricing actions increased sales they also squeezed chrysler's profit margins
49gc030p but he added that the number three u. s. auto maker made a conscious decision to sacrifice profit for a higher market share
49gc030q that move is behind chrysler's recent decisions to increase production which in turn will boost profit for the rest of the year
49gc030r the cuomo plan doesn't stop at gouging new york taxpayers and long island ratepayers
49gc030s federal taxpayers will also contribute
49gc030t the key to the deal is that lilco also would get a two point five billion dollar tax write off for shoreham
49gc030u this would guarantee that the utility won't have to pay any federal taxes for at least a decade
49gc030v new york also would help lilco float one hundred million dollars in tax exempt industrial development bonds to help pay for the cleanup
49gc030w make that de industrialization bonds
49gc030x but network officials will spend months debating c. b. s.'s wisdom
49gc030y it's time to be aggressive said mr. pilson testily taking on reporters at yesterday's press conference
49gc030z i'm up here stating that c. b. s. has acquired the rights and n. b. c. hasn't

49gc0401 as modest as the measures are even they won't be adopted without a struggle
49gc0402 the tax cuts accepted by the coalition parties have been linked to cutbacks in federal subsidies
49gc0403 such reductions could rile special interest groups and undermine parliamentary support for the entire tax program
49gc0404 moreover any tax reform must clear parliament's upper house the bundesrat where the ruling christian democratic union clings to a majority
49gc0405 some banks have already turned certain debts into securities which so far they have held rather than selling

49gc0408 the japanese stock market is awash with liquidity mr. grant says
49gc0409 but in june suddenly with no apparent drainage it went down and kept going down he says
49gc040a what is a mystery to mr. grant and many others is that the tokyo market has since staged a vigorous rebound
49gc040b the philip morris magazine enjoys by far the highest circulation of any company magazine seven point two million copies
49gc040c the only requirement is that you have an adult to receive the magazine says mary taylor associate publisher

49hc020t first interstate had a slight decline in earnings assets and negligible growth in net interest income
49hc020u non interest income fell seventeen percent partly because year earlier results included a nineteen point six million dollar pretax gain on the sale of a building
49hc020v pillsbury's loss compares with earnings of forty eight point five million dollars or fifty six cents a share in the year earlier quarter
49hc020w revenue fell two percent in the latest period to one point five billion dollars from one point five three billion dollars
