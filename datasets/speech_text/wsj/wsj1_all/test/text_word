440c040u numerous comrades were appointed most of whom graduated from universities in communist bloc nations
440c040v as with the rest of the regime however their ideology became contaminated by the germ of corruption

440c040x the saga began four years ago when pennzoil sued texaco over its acquisition of getty oil
440c040y in nineteen eighty five pennzoil won nearly eleven billion dollars in damages at trial the biggest judgment ever awarded a plaintiff

440c0414 there's no doubt we've diminished the soviet threat very substantially in the last year says minnesota representative vin weber
440c0415 but there are also risks

441c0401 mr. aziz a former english teacher is adept at delivering straight talk with diplomatic smiles that soften the harshness of his words
441c0402 but even this silver haired cigar smoking diplomat used tough words to describe america's arms sales to iran
441c0403 mr. aziz who was iraq's link to the u. s. is especially sensitive about the american deception over iran
441c0404 we felt this was an act of aggression he said without any moral or political justification

441c040g yesterday's session began with a sharp quick decline in the industrial average of more than forty five points which some market analysts attributed to foreign selling
441c040h but to the surprise of almost everyone stock prices began a steady climb that pushed the average above wednesday's close
441c040i although those gains eroded during the afternoon stock prices stayed within a narrow range until the last half hour of trading

441c040p he noted that last week's one hundred eight point drop in the dow jones industrial average resulted from a slightly weaker dollar
441c040q the markets tend to magnify the news

442c040c but there's an ugly side to what's going on in local government that deserves closer attention
442c040d u. s. exports rose in the month but not nearly as much as imports
442c040e strong imports however mean that domestic demand right now is strong one sure way to curb a trade deficit is to have a full blown recession
442c040f trade deficits weaken the dollar as they did last week and in the short run a weaker dollar means more help for exports
442c040g in the longer run the weak dollar may mean more inflation and tight money and eventually a recession
442c040h right now however the economy appears still to be growing

443c0401 several tire industry executives and analysts question whether a slimmed down firestone can prosper merely by making tires and repairing cars
443c0402 they expect companies to grow or disappear
443c0403 he has proven that he can turn a sick animal into a healthy one says harry w. millis tire analyst with mcdonald and company cleveland
443c0404 he's done very well for stockholders
443c0405 but it's difficult to see where the company goes from here
443c0406 the audio and automobile industries aren't the only ones that have let early advantages in technology or design slip away
443c0407 british appliance makers have lost ground to continental europeans who have established a reputation for design and quality standards

443c0414 a. g. edwards as it often has during the past year the saint louis firm showed up its nine new york competitors in the latest quarter
443c0415 edwards tends to select the stocks of relatively small companies often not widely followed on wall street that meet traditional value criteria
443c0416 for example it likes stocks that sell at a low multiple of the company's book value or assets minus liabilities per share
443c0417 it also favors stocks that pay good dividends

444c0403 the firm said it doesn't comment on its stock recommendations or earnings estimates
444c0404 probably the largest contributor to the earnings upturn for major producers is a new pay structure hammered out in the heavily unionized pacific northwest
444c0405 in order to stay competitive with a proliferating number of small nonunion operations in the region most companies have successfully squeezed substantial wage concessions from lumber unions
444c0406 although such efforts triggered a rash of unsuccessful strikes last summer management's adoption of the new aggressive posture had to be done says one analyst

444c040t mr. barry had been president of hartman systems a unit of figgie international incorporated
444c040u but other observers aren't so pessimistic
444c040v abby joseph cohen a portfolio strategist at drexel burnham lambert says the less than ebullient reaction was entirely in keeping with the new mood on wall street
444c040w in general investors are a conservative lot these days she says
444c040x responses tend to be muted
444c040y we're seeing a response in the right direction but it's clearly tempered by natural conservatism right now

444c0410 not everyone buys the death of the dollar thesis
444c0411 while not ruling out that the u. s. currency could decline over time mr. lipsky of salomon says he thinks the jury is still out
444c0412 he argues that friday's unemployment figures undermined the thesis of a sharply slowing economy

444c0414 mr. vagelos said that in order to market these and other drugs merck plans to increase its sales force by five hundred this year

445c0405 further slides on wall street on the other hand could have a negative impact traders say
445c0406 some investors are preparing for a short term correction this month although most believe that it won't be significant
445c0407 the article also states usually companies must keep paying workers participating in a slowdown because they continue to do their jobs and adhere to the rules
445c0408 however as suggested later in the article the employer may respond with a lockout and discontinuance of pay
445c0409 only a few states require unemployment compensation for locked out workers
445c040a for such group rate coverage employers can charge the former workers and their families the average cost of providing the health benefits plus a two percent administrative fee
445c040b in most cases that still would be less than they would pay for arranging coverage on their own
445c040c but some may be better off looking for insurance outside the employer's continued group rate plan
445c040d however in light of the stakes already held by the various factions only about ten percent of generale de belgique's shares appeared to be available on the market
445c040e this means that for mr. de benedetti to increase his stake by fifteen percent members of mr. leysen's group would have to sell to him
445c040f some sources said some of the less traditional holders of generale de belgique's shares could be tempted by the prospect of capital gains
445c040g regardless of the outcome of any meeting with gillette coniston seems almost certain to nominate its own slate of directors sometime next week
445c040h the deadline for doing so is february twenty first two months before gillette's april twenty first annual meeting
445c040i thus in order to reserve its right to launch a proxy fight coniston would need to nominate its slate by friday february nineteenth

445c040w about one point five billion dollars of debt is under review
445c040x but look a little further there are ways around hiring freezes
445c040y in a local plant the manufacturing manager needed another foreman a salaried position but there was a freeze on hiring salaried personnel
445c040z so an hourly operator was promoted to foreman but maintained on the hourly payroll
445c0410 the head count a bogus measuring device if ever there was one remained the same there was no increase in salaried personnel

446c0404 mr. simmons couldn't immediately be reached for comment
446c0405 but he said in an interview last week that he could raise five hundred million dollars pretty fast to pursue an acquisition
446c0406 that doesn't mean he will try to buy mcdermott
446c0407 in recent years he has invested in g. a. f. corporation and louisiana land and exploration company among others without bidding to acquire them

446c040d meantime more departures loom and he fears that the opportunity is fading
446c040e higher interest rates of course could be offset by higher inflation
446c040f that's more or less what the blue chip economists expect
446c040g but the federal reserve and mr. greenspan are likely to be working hard to keep inflation down
446c040h the new chairman knows that his political connections make some market participants suspicious that he will try to stimulate the economy to help g. o. p. candidates next year
446c040i mitchell held an economist at smith barney harris upham and company thinks mr. greenspan wants to establish his credentials as an inflation fighter
446c040j as signs of a stronger economy emerge he adds long term rates are likely to drift higher
