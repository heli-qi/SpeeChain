# Dataset

[*Dataset*](https://github.com/ahclab/SpeeChain/blob/main/speechain/dataset/abs.py) is the base class that takes charge of reading the data instances from the disk into the memory and packaging them into a batch for model training or testing.

A _Dataset_ object receives indices of the selected data instances from the _Dataloader_ object created by the high-level _Iterator_ object.
The output batches of packaged data instances generated by the _Dataset_ object may not be well-processed. 
Some post-processing steps need to be done in the _Model_ object later.

### speechain.dataset.abs.Dataset
This base class inherits `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and provides three hook functions: `dataset_init_fn()`, `extract_main_data_fn()`, and `collate_main_data_fn()`. 
If you want to make your own _Dataset_ implementation, please follow the instructions to override those hooks.

#### \_\_init__(self, main_data, data_selection, **dataset_conf)
* **Description:**  
  This initialization function reads the main body of the data instances into its memory. 
  The main body is used to extract individual data instances from the disk to form a batch during model training or testing.  
  The hook `dataset_init_fn()` is executed here after reading the main body files.
* **Arguments:**
  * _**main_data:**_ Dict[str, str or List[str]]  
  The main body dictionary of the data instances used in this Dataset object. 
  In each key-value item, the key is the name of the data variable and the value is the absolute path of the target _idx2data_ files.
  The value can be given as a single path string or a list of multiple path strings.
  * **_data_selection:_** List[str or List[str]] = None  
    The strategies for data selection during the iterator initialization to shrink the used data instances.
    Multiple strategies can be specified in a list. Each data selection strategy must be either a bi-list (non-meta strategy) or tri-list (meta strategy).
    1. _non-meta strategy:_  
    The rule-based selection strategies that don't involve metadata. 
    These strategies should be given as a bi-list, i.e., ['selection mode', 'selection number'].  
    'selection mode' indicates the way to select data instances while 'selection number' indicates how many data instances to be selected.  
    Currently, available non-meta selection modes include:
       1. 'order': Select the data instances from the beginning of the dataset.
       2. 'rev_order': Select the data instances from the end of the dataset.
       3. 'random': Randomly select the data instances from the dataset.  
       **Note:** You should keep the same
       random seeds for all the GPU processes in the DDP mode to ensure that the selected data instances
       are the same in each process. In this case, please set the 'same_proc_seed' argument to True in
       your configuration given to speechain.runner.py.
    2. _meta strategy:_  
    The selection strategies that involves metadata. 
    These strategies should be given as a tri-list, i.e., ['selection mode', 'selection threshold', 'metadata path'].   
    'selection mode' indicates the way to select data instances, 'selection threshold' indicates the metadata threshold to select data instances, and 'metadata path' indicates where is the metadata used for selection.  
    Currently, available meta selection modes include:
       1. 'min': Select the data instances who have smaller metadata.
       2. 'max': Select the data instances who have larger  metadata.
       3. 'middle': Remove the data instances whose metadata is the largest and smallest.
  * _****dataset_conf:**_  
  The configuration arguments for customized Dataset initialization.

#### \_\_getitem__(self, index)
* **Description:**  
    This function is the implementation of the one in the parent class `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. 
    This function is activated by the _Dataloader_ object one data instance a time. 
    In each time, this function receives an index and returns the selected data instance.  
    The hook `extract_main_data_fn()` is executed here to extract the main body of the selected data instance from the disk.   
* **Arguments:**
  * _**index:**_ str  
    The index of the selected data instance given by the _Dataloader_ object.
* **Return:** Dict[str, Any]  
    A dictionary containing a data instance.

#### data_selection(self, selection_mode, selection_num, meta_info)
* **Description:**  
    This function executes the data selection by the input selection strategy arguments. 
    A new batching view of the selected data instances will be returned.
* **Arguments:**  
  * _**selection_mode:**_ str  
    The mode indicating how the data instances are selected. 
    Selection modes are grouped by different types of data selection strategies.
    1. _non-meta strategy:_  
      The rule-based selection strategies that don't involve metadata. 
      Currently, available non-meta selection modes include:
         1. 'order': Select the data instances from the beginning of the dataset.
         2. 'rev_order': Select the data instances from the end of the dataset.
         3. 'random': Randomly select the data instances from the dataset.  
         **Note:** You should keep the same
         random seeds for all the GPU processes in the DDP mode to ensure that the selected data instances
         are the same in each process. In this case, please set the 'same_proc_seed' argument to True in
         your configuration given to speechain.runner.py.
    2. _meta strategy:_  
      The selection strategies that involves metadata. 
      Currently, available meta selection modes include:
       1. 'min': Select the data instances who have smaller metadata.
       2. 'max': Select the data instances who have larger  metadata.
       3. 'middle': Remove the data instances whose metadata is the largest and smallest.
  * _**selection_num:**_ float or int or str  
    This argument has the different usage with different data types.  
    1. _float_ type:  
    Float value represents the relative number of data instances to be selected. 
    If _selection_num_ is given as a float number, it must be between 0 and 1.
    2. _int_ type:  
    Integer value represents the absolute number of data instances to be selected. 
    If _selection_num_ is given as an interger number, it must be negative (its absolute value will be taken).
    3. _str_ type:  
    String value represents the metadata threshold used to select the data instances. 
    Only 'min' and 'max' modes support string _selection_num_.  
    **Note:** You can use the !-suffixed representer `!str` to convert a float or integer number to a string in your ._yaml_ file.
  * _**meta_info:**_ str = None  
    The path where the metadata information used for selection is placed. 
    Only the meta strategies 'min', 'max', and 'middle' need this argument.
    
* **Return:** List[str]  
    A list of indices of the selected data instances.

#### dataset_init_fn(self, **dataset_conf)
* **Description:**  
 This hook function initializes the customized part of your _Dataset_ implementations.
 This hook is not mandatory to be overridden and the original one in the base class does nothing.
 If your _Dataset_ subclass has some customized part, please override this hook function and put your logic here.
* **Arguments:**
  * _****dataset_conf:**_  
    The configuration arguments for customized Dataset initialization received from `__init__()`.

👆[Back to the API list](https://github.com/ahclab/SpeeChain/tree/main/speechain/dataset#api-document)

#### extract_main_data_fn(batch_dict, main_data)
* **Description:**  
    This hook function extracts the selected data instance from the disk to the memory. 
    The original hook in the base class does nothing and directly return `main_data`. 
    If you want to implement your own data instance extraction, please override this hook function and give your logic here.
* **Arguments:**
  * _**main_data:**_ Dict[str, str]  
    The dictionary containing necessary information for extracting the data instance from the disk to the memory. 
    For example, the audio file path for the waveform data and the feature file path for the speaker embedding.
* **Return:** Dict[str, Any]  
    The dictionary containing the extracted data instance.

#### collate_fn(self, batch)
* **Description:**  
    This hook function is used as the value of the argument `collate_fn` for initializing Dataloader object at the beginning of each epoch.  
    If you have your own batch collating strategy, we don't recommend you to override this hook but another hook named `collate_main_data_fn()`.
    This function should return the processed batch data in the form of a dictionary.
* **Arguments:**
  * _**batch:**_ List[Dict[str, Any]]  
    The tuple of data instance dictionaries extracted by `extract_main_data_fn()`.
* **Return:** Dict[str, Any]  
    The batch dictionary that will be passed to the model.

👆[Back to the API list](https://github.com/ahclab/SpeeChain/tree/main/speechain/dataset#api-document)

#### collate_main_data_fn(self, batch_dict)
* **Description:**  
    This hook function decides how to preprocess a dictionary of the extracted batch of data instances before giving them to the model. 
    The original hook in the base class packages all the elements other than strings of the batch into a `torch.Tensor`. 
    Therefore, the `torch.Tensor` elements must have the same shape. The string elements will remain a list.  
    If you have your own batch collating strategy, please override this hook function and give your logic here.
* **Arguments:**
  * _**batch_dict:**_ Dict[str, List]  
    The reshaped dictionary of the extracted batch. 
    In each key-value item, the key is the name of the data variable that will be passed to the model and the value is the list of unorganized data from all the elements in the batch.
* **Return:** Dict[str, torch.Tensor or List]  
  The dictionary containing the collated batch of data instances.

### speechain.dataset.speech_text.SpeechTextDataset
This Dataset subclass is mainly used by ASR and TTS models.   
In this subclass, each data instance is made up of an utterance and a sentence as well as the speaker information (speaker ID + speaker embedding feature).

#### extract_main_data_fn(self, main_data)
* **Description:**  
    This hook function loads speech-text data instances from the disk. 
    If the speech is in the form of raw waveforms, the last dimension will be expanded to 1 for compatibility with acoustic features like log-mel spectrogram and MFCC. 
* **Arguments:**
  * _**main_data:**_ Dict[str, str]  
    The keys of the input `main_data` dictionary should be one of the following:
    1. `feat`: speech features, can be either raw waveforms or acoustic features like log-mel or MFCC.
    2. `text`: transcript text, in the form of raw string. The tokenization will be done in the ASR and TTS models.
    3. `spk_ids`: speaker ID, in the form of raw string. The speaker discretization will be done in the ASR and TTS models.
    4. `spk_feat`: speaker embedding features.
    
    `spk_ids` and `spk_feat` are designed for multi-speaker TTS model and are not mandatory to be included in `main_data`; 
    `feat` and `text` are mandatory to be included for ASR and TTS training.  
    However, during model testing, we can choose to only include one of `feat` and `text` here to reduce the CPU burden.
* **Return:** Dict[str, Any]  
    `feat` and `spk_feat` are in the form of two-dimensional `torch.Tensor`;  
    `text` and `spk_ids` are in the form of raw strings whose discretization is done in the _Model_ object.

👆[Back to the API list](https://github.com/ahclab/SpeeChain/tree/main/speechain/dataset#api-document)

#### collate_main_data_fn(self, batch_dict)
* **Description:**  
  The utterances used for training ASR and TTS models may have different lengths, so we need to do the padding operations to make them equal in length.  
  The loaded speech feature vectors will be arranged into a single matrix with 0 padding at the end of short vectors. 
  Text data remains unprocessed strings and the tokenization will be done later in the model.
* **Arguments:**
  * _**batch_dict:**_ Dict[str, List]  
    The keys of the input `batch_dict` dictionary should be one of the following:
    1. `feat`: a _List_ of two-dimensional `torch.Tensor` with different lengths.
    2. `text`: a _List_ of text strings.
    3. `spk_ids`: a _List_ of speaker ID strings.
    4. `spk_feat`: a _List_ of two-dimensional `torch.Tensor` with equal lengths.
* **Return:** Dict[str, torch.Tensor or List]  
    `feat` and `spk_feat` are in the form of three-dimensional `torch.Tensor`;   
    `text` and `spk_ids` are in the form of _List_ of raw strings whose discretization is done in the _Model_ object.
